# moduleRequireJs

There are 3 js modules: 
- main.js: pulls the function from second.js,use it for filter by name or by job, and console the results 
- second.js: has a 'Myfilter' function to make a back copy of the given and filter it. Pulls the data from data.json
- data.json: has a collection of data

##Goal:
- passing the values between JS modules with "module.exports" object and "require" 
- data protection
